For example, a serial of system call (open, ioctl, close) are need.The containerd snapshotter daemon relies on these feature, only use a simple check method is usable in product environment. The snapshotter developers may know how cachefiles works, but for snapshotter users, a simple way to check whether snapshotter can be launched is useful. Even though they do not know how cachefiles works.

As I said, just using "bind ondemand" and "mount fsid" to check
if erofs over fscache is supported is enough.

If userspace folks don't like the internals, these logic could
be wrapped up in erofs-utils or whatever libraries.
