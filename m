occurs from the combination of a fixed point located within the system and
a GPS position retrieved from outside the system.<br /> When you walk
through your front door, either the electricity is totally turned off or
you receive a notification stating that the energy has been turned off.<br
/> This camera also has a virtual reality mode, as well as the option to
switch between various lenses, a video/picture panorama, and a
video/picture panorama.<br /> There are also MV (with a single button to
return to the home screen), headless, photo/video gestures, and front lens
adjustment modes. Each of these modes has its own set of capabilities.<br
/>Wind resistance is rated as an 8, and it is measured in meters per
second.<br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Jonathan Smith<br /> <br /> <br
