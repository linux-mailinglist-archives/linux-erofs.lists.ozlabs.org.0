So far, I’ve got uncompressed tests works, but when lz4 is enable, all test (except 001) fail. I have not found out why. You may see my progress at https://github.com/huww98/erofs-utils/tree/experimental-tests. I will send patches once everything is sorted out.

I've verified kernel version is 5.4.0-1032-azure for ubuntu-20.04, and erofs
mount succeeded. for lz4, I'm installing v1.9.3 manually from source. I haven't
tried fuse, will give it a try later.

I've downloaded "tests/results/" and it's test 007 (check for bad lz4 versions)
that fails with output "test LZ4_compress_HC_destSize(1048576) error (4098 <
4116)". And it's the same error on my PC. Investigating.

BTW, why not use a more meaningful name for each test rather than a sequence
number?
