I hope you can find time to read this over,
I want to share a message tha=
t has been spreading all over the
internet that concerns the times we are=
 living in. Whether you believe
in God or not, this is a must read messag=
e!
We can see throughout time how we have been slowly conditioned to
co=
me to this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Would i=
t surprise you to know that the Bible foretold of this event?
Don't belie=
ve me? This may be the most imporant message you will read
in these times=
...please do not ignore this!
This messsage reveals what the Mark of the =
Beast is, and the meaning
behind counting a number people have been ponde=
ring for centuries,
666. This message also shares why Barack Obama will b=
e the Antichrist
as well as the gospel message. This is truly a message f=
rom God!
In the Revelation of Jesus Christ given to the apostle John, we =
read:
...."He (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles) cause=
s
all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a=

mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may
bu=
y or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or
the nu=
mber of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate=
 the number of
the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 66=
6"
(Revelation 13:16-18 NKJV).....
Referring to the last generation, th=
is could only be speaking of a
cashless money society, which we have yet =
to see, but are heading
towards. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we c=
annot buy or sell
unless we receive the mark of the beast in our right-ha=
nd or forehead.
We could still buy or sell among one another without rece=
iving the
mark if physical money was still currency. It logically deduces=
 itself
to this reason.
These verses could not be referring to somethin=
g spiritual because
the word references two different physical locations =
(our right-hand
or forehead) stating the mark will be on one "OR" the oth=
er. It once
again logically deduces itself to this reason.
Here is wher=
e it really starts to come together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bibl=
e is concerning the RFID microchip. These are notes
from a man named Carl=
 Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to
help develop this microch=
ip in the late 1960's.
Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meet=
ings with heads of
state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates =
of the CIA to
talk about their agenda on how to bring forth this one-worl=
d system.
The US government commissioned Carl Sanders to engineer a micro=
chip
for identifying and controlling the peoples of the nations-a microch=
ip
that would be placed underneath the skin with a hypodermic needle (a=

quick, convenient procedure that would be gradually accepted by the
pe=
ople).
Carl Sanders, along with a team of engineers with him, with US gra=
nt
monies provided by US tax dollars, took on this assignment and
produ=
ced a microchip that's powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable
via the=
 temperature changes in our skin. With out having understanding
of the ho=
ly Bible (Brother Sanders was not a follower of Jesus at the
time), these=
 men spent one and a half million dollars doing research
on the best and =
most convenient spot to have the microchip inserted.
These researchers fo=
und that the forehead and the back of the hand
(the two locations Revelat=
ion says the mark will be placed) are not
only the most convenient spots,=
 but are also the only viable locations
for fast, consistent temperature =
changes within the skin to recharge
the lithium battery. The microchip is=
 approximately 7 millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter, abou=
t the dimensions of a grain
of rice. It's capable of containing many page=
s of information about
you. All your basic information, work history, cri=
me history, health
history, and financial information may be saved on thi=
s microchip.
Mr. Sanders believes that this microchip, which he remorsefu=
lly
helped design, is the "mark" mentioned in Revelation 13:16-18. The
=
Greek word for "mark" is "charagma," which is defined as a "scratch or
et=
ching." It is also fascinating to note that the number 666 is in
fact a w=
ord in the original Greek language. That word is "chi xi
stigma," with th=
e final word, "stigma," also meaning "to stick or
prick. Mr. Sanders beli=
eves this is referring to the usage of a
hypodermic needle being poked in=
 a person to insert the microchip."
Mr. Sanders asked a Boston Medical Ce=
nter doctor what would happen if
the lithium contained within the RFID mi=
crochip leaked into the body.
The doctor responded that if the microchip =
broke inside a human body,
the lithium would cause a severe and painful w=
ound filled with pus.
This is what the book of Revelation says:
"And th=
e first (angel) went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and
there came=
 an evil and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of
the beast, a=
nd those who worshipped its image" (Revelation 16:2
DARBY).
THE HIDDEN =
MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!
What I first want to mention, bef=
ore I share what the Holy Spirit has
revealed to me concerning the number=
 of the beast, is that God
confirms in threes. We can see this throughout=
 scripture:
"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father,=
 the
Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV=
).
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day
accord=
ing to the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).
"...Holy, holy, holy, L=
ord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to
come!" (Revelation 4:8 NKJV).=

There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three
o=
f them to make the point.
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first gro=
up of three I would
like to point out is that the mark of the beast is de=
scribed in three
separate verses, 16, 17 and 18.
The next three I see i=
s in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed
by three contrasting catego=
ries of people,
1 - "both small and great,
2 - rich and poor,
3 - fre=
e and slave...".
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may =
buy or sell
except one who has...", followed by three explanations of wha=
t one
must have to buy or sell,
1 - "...the mark
2 - or the name of t=
he beast,
3 - or the number of his name".
Now unto verse 18, we read "L=
et him who has understanding
calculate...", which is followed by,=C2=
=A0
1 - "the number of the beast,
2 - for it is the number of a man:
=
3 - His number is 666".
The last three I see is the number "6" being used=
 three times in a
row. The reason I'm making this point about God confirm=
ing in three is
because it is the key to unlocking how to calculate the n=
umber 666.
Throughout the centuries there have been people trying to calc=
ulate
numbers based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to=

identify one person, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do
n=
ot see where God is telling us to count up to 666, but rather to
count th=
e number of the beast. This number is identified as 666. So
the verse is =
telling us to count the number 666.
What does it mean to count? It means =
to add up. So how could we add
up 666? Remember my previous point about G=
od confirming in threes is
key to unlocking the number 666. So logically,=
 what would be the best
way to count the number 666? To count it equally =
by using the rule of
three based off the number.
We cannot count it equ=
ally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back
to the start.
We cannot=
 count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no
zeroes in betw=
een or at the end of 666.
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.
What i=
s interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count
the number i=
tself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in
Revelation Chapter 13), =
being the third verse out of the three verses
that describe the mark of t=
he beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is
18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D=
18, or 6+6+6=3D18.
Another interesting point is the only two other combin=
ations (making
a total of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" =
symbol in
between 666 are:
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.
=
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.
Why the number 144 is w=
orth our attention is because the verse
following Revelation 13:18 is the=
 first time in the Bible where the
144,000 are being described in detail:=

"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with
Hi=
m one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name
w=
ritten on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).
Now if you add up all th=
ree numbers from counting 666 by moving the
"+" symbol around, it would b=
e 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about
the number 162, is, if you div=
ide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The
name of Jesus in Greek gematria adds=
 up to 888. The New Testament was
originally written in the Greek languag=
e. Revelation 14:1 not only
mentions the 144,000, but also the Lamb who i=
s Jesus.
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that=
 if
you apply the same formula that was used to count 666, you get
8+8+=
8=3D24. Why the number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are
24 eld=
ers seated around the throne of God. This is the same throne
where Jesus =
sits.
Now if you take:
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96
=
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96
you get 24+96+96=3D216.
Take 144,000 divided by 216=
 and you get 666.
Remember that this was the same exact formula we used t=
o count the
number 666 that ultimately brought forth the number 888.
He=
re is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirms itself
as be=
ing the true way to count 666:
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=
=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888
3: 8+8+8=3D=
24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216
4: 144,000 div=
ided by 216=3D666
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...
As you can see, it =
is perpetual. And remember that we consistently
used a formula that worke=
d in threes being the number that God uses
for confirmation.
By using t=
he identical method of counting by including the plus
symbol in between t=
he numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such
a way?
The book of =
Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various
forms. For instanc=
e 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is
interesting about the number =
37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any
number that contains the same s=
ingle digit three times in a row, such
as 111 to 999, it comes out to the=
 value of if you were to add all
three numbers up. For example 888 divide=
d by 37 equals 24. So
8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+=
6=3D18. Could this be
another way of God's word confirming itself that th=
e mystery behind
calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?
Another fasci=
nating factor to note is that if you add up all the
numbers from 1 to 36 =
(1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as
in three sixes? Might thi=
s be a hint that we must add up three sixes
rather than perceiving the nu=
mber as six-hundred sixty six?
Now what may this suggest? We know in this=
 world we're identified by
numbers in various forms. From our birth certi=
ficates to our social
security card, also with our drivers license, being=
 identified founded
on a system of ruler ship. So it is conceivable that =
this RFID chip
will incorporate a new identification that has a complete =
total of 18
characters.
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind le=
t him calculate the
number of the wild beast, number for "of human" it is=
, and the number
of it 666" (Revelation 13:1, Greek Translation).
The G=
reek word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of
human=
" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two
definitions of the=
 word are "a human being, whether male or female",
and, "generically, to =
include all human individuals". Could the number
of the beast apply to al=
l mankind?
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the =
Greek
language), and other translations, you will notice the beast is
d=
escribed as an "it", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this
point i=
s because when a translation says "His number is 666", this
would imply a=
 singular person, the Antichrist. But by saying "the
number of it 666", i=
mplies that it is of the beast system as a whole.
We can know the number =
of the beast cannot be to identify products
(like a new barcode) to buy o=
r sell because scripture says we cannot
buy or sell without the number of=
 the beast. What am I getting at?
There will be instances where you could=
 buy something someone made
themselves and it wouldn't have a store brand=
ed identification on it.
But for this number to be in our chips, that is =
where it must be to
conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or sell withou=
t having the
number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Revelation 1=
3:18, the
number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", definitio=
n
"generically, to include all human individuals".
Might this be the id=
entification of the beast, the number of its
name? The one-world beast sy=
stem that's identified by 18 characters?
This would fit the scriptures th=
at speaks of a mark that we ought to
have to buy or sell in our right han=
d or forehead, and that it also
includes the number of the beast, in the =
course of a future cashless
money society.

"Why did the Biden campaign choose 30330? 2020 divided by 666 =

3.0330 Who believes this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:=

Someone said we are being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is=

taking place between good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literal=

(riots, unrest, politics). If you take the current year 2020 and
div=
ide it by the number 666 (known for its satanic implications) you
will ge=
t the number 30330 (repeated). This number 30330 happens to be
the number=
 used to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Freaky?
Supernatural? Odd =
for sure. Whatever this means, it doesn=E2=80=99t seem
good to me. First,=
 why would anyone knowingly choose those particular
numbers for their cam=
paign? If they weren=E2=80=99t knowingly chosen, then
it appears to be a =
supernatural act by the evil one himself and I
would want to change those=

 are you satanic? Is this campaign
satanic? Either way I do not believe t=
his is a coincidence. And one
thing is certain, 2020 is truly being divid=

master deceiver and spreader of chaos. Jesus calls=
 him the father of
lies."
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning J=
oe Biden, and I found
this information:=C2=A0
If you send a text to tha=
t number (at that time), you would get a
response asking to support Joe's=
 campaign to take down Donald Trump,
with one part in caps saying "CHIP I=
N >>" pointing to a link to go and
donate.
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used th=
is phrase in the past on his twitter and
people believe it is a sublimina=
l message to receive the mark of the
beast, that is to say the implantabl=
e RFID microCHIP that will go IN
our body.
The Bible warns us in the en=
d times that a false prophet will rise up
performing miracles to deceive =
many to acquire this mark:
...."and the beast was taken, and with him the=
 false prophet who did
the signs before him, in which he led astray those=
 who did receive the
mark of the beast, and those who did bow before his =
image; living they
were cast -- the two -- to the lake of the fire, that =
is burning with
brimstone" (Revelation 19:20 YLT)....
At all costs, DO =
NOT TAKE IT!
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,=
 "If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on hi=
s
forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
t=
he wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His in=
dignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence =
of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of thei=
r torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, w=
ho worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his =
name" (Revelation 14:9-11).
We're dwelling in very prophetic times with v=
ery important Biblical
prophecies being fulfilled.
When Donald Trump ac=
knowledged Jerusalem as capital of Israel on
December 6th of '17, this wa=
s a massive step to bring forth the Third
Temple prophesied within the th=
e scriptures.
The scriptures warns us that the Antichrist will seat himse=
lf in this
temple:
"...and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdi=
tion, who opposes
and exalts himself above all that is called God or that=
 is worshiped,
so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himse=
lf that he
is God" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).
In the Islamic religion, th=
ey have a man called the Mahdi, referred
to as their messiah who they're =
awaiting to appear. There are many
testimonies from individuals on line w=
ho imagine this man shall be
Barack Obama who is to be the biblical Antic=
hrist. I myself have had
unusual dreams about Barack Obama. He came on st=
age proclaiming
himself to be a follower of Christ with no affiliation to=
 the Muslim
religion, but was later revealed by his family that he certai=
nly is a
faithful Muslim.
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone=
s name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has given nam=
es to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about =
the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath t=
he surface...
Jesus says, "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like li=
ghtning
from heaven'" (Luke 10:18).
In Hebrew, the name "Barack" means =
"lighting", and the usage of
"Bama" (Strongs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used =
to mean the "heights" of
heaven.

The day after the election of=
 Barack Obama (11/04/08), the triumphing
pick three lotto numbers in Illi=
nois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic state) for
11/5/08 were 666.
Obama was a=
 U.S. senator for the state of Illinois, and his zip code
was 60606.
Re=
gardless, whomsoever seats himself in the future Third Temple in
Jerusale=
m, declaring himself to be God WILL BE THE ANTICHRIST. NEVER
FORGET.
So=
, why do we need Jesus Christ?
"for all have sinned and fall short of the=
 glory of God" (Romans
2:23).
"For the wages of sin is death, but the g=
ift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
Our=
 good works can't save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty
of a c=
rime, the judge is not going to judge us by the good that we've
carried o=
ut, but rather the crimes we've committed. If we as fallen
humanity, crea=
ted in God's image, pose this type of moral justice, how
much more a perf=
ect, righteous, and Holy creator?
God has delivered to us His moral law's=
 by the ten commandments
received by Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guid=
elines were not given
so we can be justified, however in order that we mi=
ght see the need
for the savior. They're the mirror of God's character of=
 what He has
put in each and every one of us, with our conscious bearing =
witness
that we know that it is an act of evil to steal, lie, dishonor ou=
r dad
and mom, and so on.
We may try to observe all the moral guideline=
s of the ten
commandments, however we'll never catch up to them to be jus=
tified
before a Holy God. That same word of the law given to Moses manife=
sted
as flesh over 2000 years ago within the body of Jesus Christ. He was=

brought forth to be our justification by perfectly fulfilling the
comm=
andments of God, living a sinless life that solely God may
fulfill.
The=
 gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, how=
ever the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and
mercy of God. And=
 if we're to seize hold of, by faith in Him, He'll
pull us up being the o=
ne to justify us. As within the court of law, if
someone steps in and pay=
s your fine, despite the fact that you are
guilty, the judge can do what'=
s legal and just and let you go free.
That is what Jesus did nearly 2000 =
years in the past on the cross. It
was a legal transaction being fulfille=
d within the spiritual realm by
the shedding of His blood, with His final=
 words being, "...It is
finished!..." (John 19:30).
So why did Jesus ha=
ve to die for us?
Because God is Holy and just, the wrath that belongs to=
 us could not
go unnoticed. Through the perfect righteousness and justice=
 of God's
character, it ought to be reconciled, it ought to be quenched a=
nd
satisfied.
For God takes no pleasure in the dying of the wicked (Eze=
kiel 18:23).
That is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the com=
ing
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it=

satisfied God to crush His only begotten Son.
That is because the wrat=
h that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son. For if =
it were to be poured out upon us
who've earned it, we'd all perish and go=
 to hell. God created a means
of escape by pouring it out on His Son who'=
s soul could not be left in
Hades, however was raised and seated on the r=
ight hand of God in
power.
Now once we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Ro=
mans 13:14), God no
longer looks at the person who deserves His wrath, bu=
t now the
glorious image of His perfect Son living within, justifying us =
as if
we obtained the wrath we deserve, making a means of escape from the=

curse of death.
Now what we ought to do is turn from our sins and beli=
eve in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sins. That is not just a =
head
knowledge of believing in Jesus, instead receiving His words, taking=

them to heart. In which we no longer live to exercise sin, however
tur=
n away from our sins and exercise righteousness:
"Do you not know that th=
e unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of
God? Do not be deceived. Ne=
ither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor so=
domites, nor thieves, nor covetous,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor exto=
rtioners will inherit the kingdom
of God. And such were some of you. But =
you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you were justified in the n=
ame of the Lord Jesus and
by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corinthians 6:9-11=
).
By doing so we will become transformed into the image of God by faith=

in His Son Christ Jesus Who's inclined to provide the Holy Spirit to
w=
hoever ask of Him:
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, unless one is b=
orn of water
and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That whi=
ch is born
of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is=
 spirit.
Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' (Joh=
n
3:5-6).
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed th=
e Spirit
of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of=

Christ, he is not His" (Romans 8:9).
Now what are you waiting for? Our=
 heavenly Father only wishes the
best for us all, restoring every thing t=
his world has stolen from us.
That is what it means to be "holy". To be m=
ade whole.
He's waiting to hear from you. That God given tongue to speak=

language, by faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgive you by confessing
=
your sins and be willing to forsake them; that you accept the
sacrifice o=
f His Son Jesus on the cross, and that you want His Holy
Spirit dwelling =
inside you reworking you into a child of the living
God.
Jesus says, "b=
ut whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him
(the Holy Spirit) wi=
ll never thirst. But the water that I shall give
him will become in him a=
 fountain of water springing up into
everlasting life."
Did you know th=
at Jesus spoke more about hell than any one in the
scriptures, even more =
than He spoke about heaven?! For this very
reason He was brought forth to=
 die for us, to deliver us from this
place that we deserve.
=C2=A0
He=
 describes hell as a actual place where,
"Their worm does not die
And t=
he fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44).
And where,
"There will be weeping=
 and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13:28).
Jesus tells us who to fear,
"A=
nd do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.
But rath=
er fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell"
(Matthew 1=
0:28).
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and =
the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John=
,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,=

prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice
=
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
wi=
ll dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
be wit=
h them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
their eye=
s; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be n=
o more pain, for the former things have passed away.'
Then He who sat on =
the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He said to me, 'Wri=
te, for these words are true and faithful.'
And He said to me, 'It is don=
e! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I will give o=
f the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts. He who ove=
rcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he shall be My=
 son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immo=
ral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lak=
e
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.'"
(Re=
velation 21:1-8).

<body>I hope you can find time to read this over,<br />
<br />
I want to share a message that has been spreading all over the internet tha=
t concerns the times we are living in. Whether you believe in God or not, t=
his is a must read message!<br />
<br />
We can see throughout time how we have been slowly conditioned to come to t=
his point where we are on the verge of a cashless society. Would it surpris=
e you to know that the Bible foretold of this event? Don't believe me? This=
 may be the most imporant message you will read in these times...please do =
not ignore this!<br />
<br />
This messsage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and the meaning behind=
 counting a number people have been pondering for centuries, 666. This mess=
age also shares why Barack Obama will be the Antichrist as well as the gosp=
el message. This is truly a message from God!<br />
<br />
In the Revelation of Jesus Christ given to the apostle John, we read:<br />
<br />
...."He (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles) causes all, b=
oth small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on th=
eir right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell excep=
t one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.=
<br />
<br />
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the b=
east, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666" (Revelation 13:16-1=
8 NKJV).....<br />
<br />
Referring to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a cashless=
 money society, which we have yet to see, but are heading towards. Why? Rev=
elation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or sell unless we receive the mar=
k of the beast in our right-hand or forehead. We could still buy or sell am=
ong one another without receiving the mark if physical money was still curr=
ency. It logically deduces itself to this reason.<br />
<br />
These verses could not be referring to something spiritual because the word=
 references two different physical locations (our right-hand or forehead) s=
tating the mark will be on one "OR" the other. It once again logically dedu=
ces itself to this reason.<br />
<br />
Here is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how accurat=
e the Bible is concerning the RFID microchip. These are notes from a man na=
med Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help develop this m=
icrochip in the late 1960's.<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with heads of state =
officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the CIA to talk about th=
eir agenda on how to bring forth this one-world system. The US government c=
ommissioned Carl Sanders to engineer a microchip for identifying and contro=
lling the peoples of the nations-a microchip that would be placed underneat=
h the skin with a hypodermic needle (a quick, convenient procedure that wou=
ld be gradually accepted by the people).<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders, along with a team of engineers with him, with US grant monies=
 provided by US tax dollars, took on this assignment and produced a microch=
ip that's powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable via the temperature ch=
anges in our skin. With out having understanding of the holy Bible (Brother=
 Sanders was not a follower of Jesus at the time), these men spent one and =
a half million dollars doing research on the best and most convenient spot =
to have the microchip inserted.<br />
<br />
These researchers found that the forehead and the back of the hand (the two=
 locations Revelation says the mark will be placed) are not only the most c=
onvenient spots, but are also the only viable locations for fast, consisten=
t temperature changes within the skin to recharge the lithium battery. The =
microchip is approximately 7 millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in diam=
eter, about the dimensions of a grain of rice. It's capable of containing m=
any pages of information about you. All your basic information, work histor=
y, crime history, health history, and financial information may be saved on=
 this microchip.<br />
<br />
Mr. Sanders believes that this microchip, which he remorsefully helped desi=
gn, is the "mark" mentioned in Revelation 13:16-18. The Greek word for "mar=
k" is "charagma," which is defined as a "scratch or etching." It is also fa=
scinating to note that the number 666 is in fact a word in the original Gre=
ek language. That word is "chi xi stigma," with the final word, "stigma," a=
lso meaning "to stick or prick. Mr. Sanders believes this is referring to t=
he usage of a hypodermic needle being poked in a person to insert the micro=
chip."<br />
<br />
Mr. Sanders asked a Boston Medical Center doctor what would happen if the l=
ithium contained within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor=
 responded that if the microchip broke inside a human body, the lithium wou=
ld cause a severe and painful wound filled with pus. This is what the book =
of Revelation says:<br />
<br />
"And the first (angel) went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and there=
 came an evil and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast=
, and those who worshipped its image" (Revelation 16:2 DARBY).<br />
<br />
THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!<br />
<br />
What I first want to mention, before I share what the Holy Spirit has revea=
led to me concerning the number of the beast, is that God confirms in three=
s. We can see this throughout scripture:<br />
<br />
"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and=
 the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to =
the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"...Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" (R=
evelation 4:8 NKJV).<br />
<br />
There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three of the=
m to make the point.<br />
<br />
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first group of three I would like to =
point out is that the mark of the beast is described in three separate vers=
es, 16, 17 and 18.<br />
<br />
The next three I see is in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed by thre=
e contrasting categories of people,<br />
<br />
1 - "both small and great,<br />
2 - rich and poor,<br />
3 - free and slave...".<br />
<br />
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may buy or sell except =
one who has...", followed by three explanations of what one must have to bu=
y or sell,<br />
<br />
1 - "...the mark<br />
2 - or the name of the beast,<br />
3 - or the number of his name".<br />
<br />
Now unto verse 18, we read "Let him who has understanding calculate...", wh=
ich is followed by,=C2=A0<br />
<br />
1 - "the number of the beast,<br />
2 - for it is the number of a man:<br />
3 - His number is 666".<br />
<br />
The last three I see is the number "6" being used three times in a row. The=
 reason I'm making this point about God confirming in three is because it i=
s the key to unlocking how to calculate the number 666.<br />
<br />
Throughout the centuries there have been people trying to calculate numbers=
 based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to identify one p=
erson, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do not see where God is=
 telling us to count up to 666, but rather to count the number of the beast=
. This number is identified as 666. So the verse is telling us to count the=
 number 666.<br />
<br />
What does it mean to count? It means to add up. So how could we add up 666?=
 Remember my previous point about God confirming in threes is key to unlock=
ing the number 666. So logically, what would be the best way to count the n=
umber 666? To count it equally by using the rule of three based off the num=
ber.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back to th=
e start.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no zeroes =
in between or at the end of 666.<br />
<br />
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
What is interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count the numb=
er itself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in Revelation Chapter 13)=
, being the third verse out of the three verses that describe the mark of t=
he beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is 18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D18=
, or 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
Another interesting point is the only two other combinations (making a tota=
l of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" symbol in between 666 a=
re:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.<br />
<br />
Why the number 144 is worth our attention is because the verse following Re=
velation 13:18 is the first time in the Bible where the 144,000 are being d=
escribed in detail:<br />
<br />
"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one=
 hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name written =
on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).<br />
<br />
Now if you add up all three numbers from counting 666 by moving the "+" sym=
bol around, it would be 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about the number=
 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The name of Jesus in G=
reek gematria adds up to 888. The New Testament was originally written in t=
he Greek language. Revelation 14:1 not only mentions the 144,000, but also =
the Lamb who is Jesus.<br />
<br />
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that if you app=
ly the same formula that was used to count 666, you get 8+8+8=3D24. Why the=
 number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are 24 elders seated around=
 the throne of God. This is the same throne where Jesus sits.<br />
<br />
Now if you take:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96<br />
<br />
you get 24+96+96=3D216.<br />
<br />
Take 144,000 divided by 216 and you get 666.<br />
<br />
Remember that this was the same exact formula we used to count the number 6=
66 that ultimately brought forth the number 888.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirms itself as be=
ing the true way to count 666:<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162<br />
<br />
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888<br />
<br />
3: 8+8+8=3D24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216<br />
<br />
4: 144,000 divided by 216=3D666<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is perpetual. And remember that we consistently used a f=
ormula that worked in threes being the number that God uses for confirmatio=
n.<br />
<br />
By using the identical method of counting by including the plus symbol in b=
etween the numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a way?<br />
<br />
The book of Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various forms. F=
or instance 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is interesting about the=
 number 37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any number that contains the =
same single digit three times in a row, such as 111 to 999, it comes out to=
 the value of if you were to add all three numbers up. For example 888 divi=
ded by 37 equals 24. So 8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+=
6=3D18. Could this be another way of God's word confirming itself that the =
mystery behind calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?<br />
<br />
Another fascinating factor to note is that if you add up all the numbers fr=
om 1 to 36 (1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as in three sixes? =
Might this be a hint that we must add up three sixes rather than perceiving=
 the number as six-hundred sixty six?<br />
<br />
Now what may this suggest? We know in this world we're identified by number=
s in various forms. From our birth certificates to our social security card=
, also with our drivers license, being identified founded on a system of ru=
ler ship. So it is conceivable that this RFID chip will incorporate a new i=
dentification that has a complete total of 18 characters.<br />
<br />
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let him calculate the number o=
f the wild beast, number for "of human" it is, and the number of it 666" (R=
evelation 13:1, Greek Translation).<br />
<br />
The Greek word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of hu=
man" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two definitions of th=
e word are "a human being, whether male or female", and, "generically, to i=
nclude all human individuals". Could the number of the beast apply to all m=
ankind?<br />
<br />
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the Greek languag=
e), and other translations, you will notice the beast is described as an "i=
t", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this point is because when a tr=
anslation says "His number is 666", this would imply a singular person, the=
 Antichrist. But by saying "the number of it 666", implies that it is of th=
e beast system as a whole.<br />
<br />
We can know the number of the beast cannot be to identify products (like a =
new barcode) to buy or sell because scripture says we cannot buy or sell wi=
thout the number of the beast. What am I getting at? There will be instance=
s where you could buy something someone made themselves and it wouldn't hav=
e a store branded identification on it. But for this number to be in our ch=
ips, that is where it must be to conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or =
sell without having the number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Rev=
elation 13:18, the number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", de=
finition "generically, to include all human individuals".<br />
<br />
Might this be the identification of the beast, the number of its name? The =
one-world beast system that's identified by 18 characters? This would fit t=
he scriptures that speaks of a mark that we ought to have to buy or sell in=
 our right hand or forehead, and that it also includes the number of the be=
ast, in the course of a future cashless money society.<br />

"Why did the Biden campaign choose 30330? 2020 divided by 666 =3D 3.0330 Wh=
o believes this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:6 Someone said =
we are being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is taking place betw=
een good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literally (riots, unrest, p=
olitics). If you take the current year 2020 and divide it by the number 666=
 (known for its satanic implications) you will get the number 30330 (repeat=
ed). This number 30330 happens to be the number used to vote for Joe Biden =
and Kamala Harris. Freaky? Supernatural? Odd for sure. Whatever this means,=
 it doesn=E2=80=99t seem good to me. First, why would anyone knowingly choo=
se those particular numbers for their campaign? If they weren=E2=80=99t kno=
wingly chosen, then it appears to be a supernatural act by the evil one him=
self and I would want to change those numbers ASAP. And if the numbers were=
 chosen knowing their significance, are you satanic? Is this campaign satan=
ic? Either way I do not believe this is a coincidence. And one thing is cer=
tain, 2020 is truly being divided by Satan. He is the master deceiver and s=
preader of chaos. Jesus calls him the father of lies."<br />
<br />
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, and I found this inf=
ormation:=C2=A0<br />
<br />
If you send a text to that number (at that time), you would get a response =
asking to support Joe's campaign to take down Donald Trump, with one part i=
n caps saying "CHIP IN >>" pointing to a link to go and donate.<br />
<br />
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase in the past on his twitter and people=
 believe it is a subliminal message to receive the mark of the beast, that =
is to say the implantable RFID microCHIP that will go IN our body.<br />
<br />
The Bible warns us in the end times that a false prophet will rise up perfo=
rming miracles to deceive many to acquire this mark:<br />
<br />
...."and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the si=
gns before him, in which he led astray those who did receive the mark of th=
e beast, and those who did bow before his image; living they were cast -- t=
he two -- to the lake of the fire, that is burning with brimstone" (Revelat=
ion 19:20 YLT)....<br />
<br />
At all costs, DO NOT TAKE IT!<br />

"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone wor=
ships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on =
his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, whic=
h is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be =
tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in=
 the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever a=
nd ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his =
image, and whoever receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11).<br =

<br />
We're dwelling in very prophetic times with very important Biblical prophec=
ies being fulfilled.<br />
<br />
When Donald Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as capital of Israel on December 6=
th of '17, this was a massive step to bring forth the Third Temple prophesi=
ed within the the scriptures.<br />
<br />
The scriptures warns us that the Antichrist will seat himself in this templ=
e:<br />
<br />
"...and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and e=
xalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he=
 sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God" (2 Thess=
alonians 2:3-4).<br />
<br />
In the Islamic religion, they have a man called the Mahdi, referred to as t=
heir messiah who they're awaiting to appear. There are many testimonies fro=
m individuals on line who imagine this man shall be Barack Obama who is to =
be the biblical Antichrist. I myself have had unusual dreams about Barack O=
bama. He came on stage proclaiming himself to be a follower of Christ with =
no affiliation to the Muslim religion, but was later revealed by his family=
 that he certainly is a faithful Muslim.<br />
<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someones name can say a lot about a p=
erson. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specifi=
c meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us take=
 a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface...<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from hea=
ven'" (Luke 10:18).<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the name "Barack" means "lighting", and the usage of "Bama" (Str=
ongs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used to mean the "heights" of heaven.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
The day after the election of Barack Obama (11/04/08), the triumphing pick =
three lotto numbers in Illinois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic state) for 11/5/0=
8 were 666.<br />
<br />
Obama was a U.S. senator for the state of Illinois, and his zip code was 60=
606.<br />
<br />
Regardless, whomsoever seats himself in the future Third Temple in Jerusale=
m, declaring himself to be God WILL BE THE ANTICHRIST. NEVER FORGET.<br />
<br />
So, why do we need Jesus Christ?<br />
<br />
"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 2:23).<br =
/>
<br />
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Chri=
st Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).<br />
<br />
Our good works can't save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a =
crime, the judge is not going to judge us by the good that we've carried ou=
t, but rather the crimes we've committed. If we as fallen humanity, created=
 in God's image, pose this type of moral justice, how much more a perfect, =
righteous, and Holy creator?<br />
<br />
God has delivered to us His moral law's by the ten commandments received by=
 Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guidelines were not given so we can be jus=
tified, however in order that we might see the need for the savior. They're=
 the mirror of God's character of what He has put in each and every one of =
us, with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is an act of ev=
il to steal, lie, dishonor our dad and mom, and so on.<br />
<br />
We may try to observe all the moral guidelines of the ten commandments, how=
ever we'll never catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That s=
ame word of the law given to Moses manifested as flesh over 2000 years ago =
within the body of Jesus Christ. He was brought forth to be our justificati=
on by perfectly fulfilling the commandments of God, living a sinless life t=
hat solely God may fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, ho=
wever the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And =
if we're to seize hold of, by faith in Him, He'll pull us up being the one =
to justify us. As within the court of law, if someone steps in and pays you=
r fine, despite the fact that you are guilty, the judge can do what's legal=
 and just and let you go free. That is what Jesus did nearly 2000 years in =
the past on the cross. It was a legal transaction being fulfilled within th=
e spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood, with His final words being,=
 "...It is finished!..." (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
So why did Jesus have to die for us?<br />
<br />
Because God is Holy and just, the wrath that belongs to us could not go unn=
oticed. Through the perfect righteousness and justice of God's character, i=
t ought to be reconciled, it ought to be quenched and satisfied.<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the dying of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). That =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it satisfied God to crush =
His only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
That is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. For if it were to be poured out upon us who've earned it, we=
'd all perish and go to hell. God created a means of escape by pouring it o=
ut on His Son who's soul could not be left in Hades, however was raised and=
 seated on the right hand of God in power.<br />
<br />
Now once we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), God no longer look=
s at the person who deserves His wrath, but now the glorious image of His p=
erfect Son living within, justifying us as if we obtained the wrath we dese=
rve, making a means of escape from the curse of death.<br />
<br />
Now what we ought to do is turn from our sins and believe in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins. That is not just a head knowledge of belie=
ving in Jesus, instead receiving His words, taking them to heart. In which =
we no longer live to exercise sin, however turn away from our sins and exer=
cise righteousness:<br />
<br />
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? =
Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor=
 homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor =
revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were s=
ome of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were just=
ified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corint=
hians 6:9-11).<br />
<br />
By doing so we will become transformed into the image of God by faith in Hi=
s Son Christ Jesus Who's inclined to provide the Holy Spirit to whoever ask=
 of Him:<br />
<br />
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, unless one is born of water and the =
Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh=
 is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel th=
at I said to you, 'You must be born again.' (John 3:5-6).<br />
<br />
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of Go=
d dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is no=
t His" (Romans 8:9).<br />
<br />
Now what are you waiting for? Our heavenly Father only wishes the best for =
us all, restoring every thing this world has stolen from us. That is what i=
t means to be "holy". To be made whole.<br />
<br />
He's waiting to hear from you. That God given tongue to speak language, by =
faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgive you by confessing your sins and be w=
illing to forsake them; that you accept the sacrifice of His Son Jesus on t=
he cross, and that you want His Holy Spirit dwelling inside you reworking y=
ou into a child of the living God.<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him (the Hol=
y Spirit) will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will becom=
e in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."<br />
<br />
Did you know that Jesus spoke more about hell than any one in the scripture=
s, even more than He spoke about heaven?! For this very reason He was broug=
ht forth to die for us, to deliver us from this place that we deserve.<br /=
>
=C2=A0<br />
He describes hell as a actual place where,<br />
<br />
"Their worm does not die<br />
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44).<br />
<br />
And where,<br />
<br />
"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13:28).<br />
<br />
Jesus tells us who to fear,<br />
<br />
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rath=
er fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:=
28).<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8).<img width=3D"1" height=3D"1" src=3D"http:/=
