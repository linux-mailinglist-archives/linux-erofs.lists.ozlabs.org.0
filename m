TL;DR I don't think we can just wave away the change as "the problem has
always been there".

Firstly, the fact that something is not quite reliable on NFS doesn't mean
people don't rely on the behavior on local filesystems. NFS has a
historical reputation of being a bit weird ;). Secondly, I agree that the
same problems can manifest currently for files on two filesystems with
different timestamp granularity. But again that is something that is rare -
widely used filesystems have a granularity of a jiffy and in most cases
build and source files are on the same filesystem anyway. So yes, in
principle the problems could happen even before multigrain timestamps but
having different granularity per inode just made them manifest in much much
more setups and that matters because setups that were perfectly fine before
are not anymore.

Regarding whether the problem is real: I wouldn't worry too much about the
particular test that started this thread. That seems like something very
special. But the build system issues could be real - as you wrote in your
motivation for the series - a lot can happen in a jiffy on contemporary
computers. I can imagine build product having newer timestamp than build
source because the modification of source managed to squeeze into the same
jiffy and still use a coarse-grained timestamp. Or some other
producer-consumer type of setup... Sure usually there would be enough
stat(2) calls on both sides to force finegrained timestamps on both files
but if there are not in some corner case, debugging the problem is really
tough.

From a first glance I'd guess the performance overhead will be too big for
a busy filesystem to enable this unconditionally. But I could be wrong...
