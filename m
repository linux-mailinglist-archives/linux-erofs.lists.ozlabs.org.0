... And another fundamental concern is that if we don't verify earlier
(I mean on-disk data), then untrusted data will be transformed
(decompressed and even decrypted if no inline encryption) with risk,
and it seems _vulnerable_ if such decrypt / decompress algorithms have
_security issues_ (such as Buffer Overflow). It seems that it's less
security than do verity earlier.
