<pre>Hello,<br /><br />How are things going for you?<br />Have you gotten
the introduction to the little quadcopter that we sent you last week?<br
/><br />The quadcopter can fly continuously for 30 minutes while recording
video at a frame rate of 25 frames per second.<br />45x40x12cm product
dimensions (before folding) 21x11x9cm (after folding)<br />Dual-mode GPS
positioning is provided by the positioning system. Model number for a
brushless motor is 1806.<br />Remote control range: around 3000m<br />The
height of the remote control is approximately 120 meters.<br />1-3 meters
for shooting gesture recognition Aerial image resolution: 4096 x 3072
(APP)<br />Video resolution: 2048 x 1080 (APP)<br />Transmission frame
rate: 25 frames per second<br />With the click of a button, you may command
the aircraft to take off, land, and even return to its original
location.<br />When summoned, the quadcopter will return to its original
spot.<br />Fixed-point surround: With this professional quadcopter, you can
now create breathtaking films without doing any extra work.<br /><br />The

<pre><br /><br />When you walk through your front door, the electricity is
either completely switched off or you receive a notification that it has
been turned off.<br />This camera also includes a virtual reality mode, the
ability to swap between lenses, a video/picture panorama, and a
video/picture panorama.<br />There are also MV (return to home screen with
a single button), headless, photo/video gestures, and front lens adjustment
modes. Each of these modes has unique capabilities.<br />The GPS and air
pressure combination used in the fixed-altitude flight system is
effectively a mixture of the two technologies.<br />Wind resistance is
rated 8 and measured in meters per second.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br
/>Jason Spike<br /><br /><br />======<br /><br />Is printing this email
