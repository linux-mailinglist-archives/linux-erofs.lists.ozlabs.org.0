Yeah, if the number of common used xattr (n) is 30, then the optimal
value for the number of the hash functions (k) is 1 (ln2 * m/n = 0.74).
The optimal value in theory also matches our intuition.

Excellent research!  Would you mind sharing the list of these
approximately 30 commonly used xattrs, so that I could check if they are
mapped to unique bucket with the single hash function we proposed?
