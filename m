When hacking on systemd, we would like to be able to rebuild the disk image as fast as possible. One part of rebuilding the image that takes a while is generating the erofs filesystem. I had a look at the mkfs source code for erofs and noticed that in
>> write_uncompressed_file_from_fd(), there is no usage of FICLONERANGE or copy_file_range() to speed up copying data from the filesystem to the erofs filesystem. Would it be possible to use either of these to make copying data in mkfs.erofs faster when the data does not need to be compressed?

I already checked this part, it optimizes about 100ms for
the linux source code tree on my own developping machine.

Also after some profiling, there are some other stuffs that
needs to be optmized as well (e.g. optimize metadata write
counts)

Anyway, I'm about releasing erofs-utils v1.7.  I tend to
resolve this in the next version and there are a lot
TODOs on my side.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
