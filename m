<p>Hi,<br /> <br /> How are you?<br /> Has the presentation about the drone
that was supplied to you earlier today been received?<br /> I'll send you
another email about this drone. Thank you for your understanding.<br /> <br
/> On a single charge, the drone's battery lasts for 30 minutes.<br />
Approximately 1000m of security fence separates the electrically controlled
perimeter from the rest of the property.<br /> The GPS position is outside
the optical flow fixed point, but it is within the optical flow fixed point
during the time of measurement.<br /> Making use of the power off/on
signal, you can return to your place on a low-power mode.<br /> There are
handy capabilities included, such as the MV (multi-view) mode, one-button
return to the home screen, headless mode, definition switching, gesture
photo/video, and the ability to adjust the front lens up and down. <br />
Wind resistance is rated at an 8. (high wind resistance)<br /> The fan
blades have a diameter of roughly 5.8 cm and are made of aluminum (in
centimeters).<br /> The battery has a capacity of 7.4V 3000mAh when used in
conjunction with the board.<br /> A battery's capacity is critical when
dealing with batteries (with charging)<br /> Dimensions of the drone: When
fully unfolded, the finished size is 26x30x5cm (when fully unfurled).<br />
<br /> Pricing for our drones:<br /> For one drone at 288.50<br /> For two
drones at 278.50 each<br /> For three drones at 268.50 each<br /> <br />
Are you interested in receiving one or two? <br /> Send us the location of
your shipment, and we'll get in touch with logistics to make the
preparations for you.<br /><br /><img

width="450" height="450" /><br /> <br /> <br /> Optical flow is formed by
combining a fixed point positioned within the system and GPS positioning
located outside.<br /> The power goes out or you receive a notification
suggesting that the energy has been turned off when you return to your
house.<br /> Additionally, this camera includes a virtual reality mode as
well as multi-lens switching, as well as a video/picture panorama and a
video/picture panorama.<br /> Additionally, there are modes, such as MV
(with a single button for returning to the home screen), headless,
photo/video gestures, and front lens adjustment.<br /> When it comes to the
fixed altitude flight system, the GPS/air pressure combination used is a
hybrid of the two technologies.<br /> The level of wind resistance is 8)
for wind resistance.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Mayson Dunlap</p>
